Arduino Project #3. Clap/Motion Controlled PC Activator.
Start Date: March 21st 2018
Completion Date: Not yet complete.
Refactoring/Cleaning: Partial.

Device contains microphone, motion sensor and ethernet shield.
Upon detecting motion or a double clap it will determine if the host is alive, if not it will send a WOL magic packet to the specified PC.
If the host is alive then it will send a WOL magic packet to the PC in reverse order. This is intercepted by sotware running on the PC which will put it to sleep.
The afformentioned software is not included in the OS and needs to be created.

This project is also presently incomplete due to high university workload.
